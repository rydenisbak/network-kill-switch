# network-kill-switch: check the installed lock and prove it with pf packet counters.
#
#   sudo bash check.sh                # all safe checks (P0-P9)
#   sudo bash check.sh --short        # main checks only (P0-P3 and P5)
#   sudo bash check.sh --heal-tests   # also P10-P11 (for maintainers, see below)
#
# What it checks: the daemon and the pf rule are in place; a packet that leaves outside the
# tunnel is dropped by the kernel (the rule's counter goes up); traffic through the tunnel is
# not touched; Claude still works through the tunnel; other services are not affected.
# --heal-tests also removes the rule and the table and waits for the daemon to put them back
# (P10), and reloads /etc/pf.conf (P11). Each removal leaves watched traffic unblocked outside
# the tunnel for about one 5 s tick (the script waits up to 15 s). Off by default; meant for
# maintainers (tests/acceptance.sh).
#
# Safety rule: this script never sends a request to Anthropic outside the tunnel until it has
# proven on the control address 203.0.113.7 (TEST-NET-3, not routed on the internet) that
# such a packet is dropped.
#
# Exit code: the number of failed checks; 100 = no check failed, but some are NOT MEASURED.
